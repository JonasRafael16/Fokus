## Introduction

Fokus is a web-based application created to enhance your productivity. It leverages the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method, to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Fokus provides a focused work session ("Foco"), short break, and long break timer, allowing you to customize your work-rest intervals.

## Features

- **Timer Options**: Choose between Foco (focused work), Descanso curto (short break), and Descanso longo (long break) intervals.
- **Background Music**: Toggle background music on/off to create a personalized work environment.
- **Intuitive Interface**: User-friendly design with clear buttons and a prominent timer display.
- **Start/Pause Functionality**: Easily start or pause your work sessions with the primary button.
